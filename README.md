## Environment 
We utilize a conda environment to manage our Python dependencies. For a full 
review of using conda environments please see the [docs](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). 
With conda installed, you may activate the environment from the 
*environment.yml* file by issuing the command:

> $ conda env create -f environment.yml 

If you're adding dependencies, please update the *environment.yml* file by 
issuing the command:

> $ conda env export > environment.yml 

Thank you!
